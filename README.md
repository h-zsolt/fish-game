### Description

In this game the player needs to click on the fishes to accumulate points and it has a sandbox mode and a timed arcade-like mode to pick from. The fishes gradually increase in number and difficulty in speed, diagonal movement and alternating movement patterns. This was the first C++ project made as part of my university studies.

### Instructions

This project was made using JetBrains CLion, once the project is built using the project's CMake file, the project can be built and run using the Game + GameData build setting. The initial build may fail if the executable is left unassigned at the first start, but it will prompt the user to select one.

### Source Code

Source code made for this project can be found in the /src/game directory.

### Learning Outcomes

The goal of this project was for the students to learn and familiarize themselves with the custom university provided OpenGL-based API / Engine. The assignment had a list of extended goals, of which the following were achieved:

- Ensure fish spawn within the window
- Why not let the fish head in different directions?
- Implement random velocities for the clown fish
- Allow multiple fish on the screen at any one time
- Add a timer to the HUD
    - How many in a minute
